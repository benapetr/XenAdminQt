/**
 * @brief VIF - A virtual network interface
 *
 * Qt equivalent of C# XenAPI.VIF class. Represents a virtual network interface.
 *
 * Key properties (from C# VIF class):
 * - device (order in which VIF backends are created)
 * - network (virtual network this VIF is connected to)
 * - VM (virtual machine this VIF is connected to)
 * - MAC (ethernet MAC address)
 * - MTU (maximum transmission unit)
 * - currently_attached (whether device is currently attached)
 * - locking_mode (network locking mode)
 * - ipv4_allowed, ipv6_allowed (IP filtering)
 * - qos_algorithm_type, qos_algorithm_params (QoS settings)
 *
 * First published in XenServer 4.0.
